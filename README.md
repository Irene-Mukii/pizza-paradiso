* Create HTML forms as primary step.
* For business logic: Use constructors to store input data.
* Use innerHTML to output the order to user for tracking.
* Create a function that gives the total cost for just one pizza.
* Calculate the delivery fee as part of total cost.
* Add option for ni delivery.
* Calculate total cost if user inputs two pizzas with different properties.
* create a  loop to calculate as many pizza entries as user requires
